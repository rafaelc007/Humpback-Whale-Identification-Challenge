# Humpback-Whale-Identification-Challenge
Projetecto from Kaggle
This training data contains thousands of images of humpback whale flukes. Individual whales have been identified by researchers and given an Id. The challenge is to predict the whale Id of images in the test set. What makes this such a challenge is that there are only a few examples for each of 3,000+ whale Ids.
File descriptions

    train.zip - a folder containing the training images
    train.csv - maps the training Image to the appropriate whale Id. Whales that are not predicted to have a label identified in the training data should be labeled as new_whale.
    test.zip - a folder containing the test images to predict the whale Id
    sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format
